My own LISP dialect, crafted with love.

Inspired by Scheme and SICP. Simple, fast, extensible, it requires less code to complete simple task or computation. 

Now language support basic arithmetic operations and I am trying to concentrate on concept ^^

Enjoy!


# Operators

+ 4 5  #=> 9
- 2 1  #=> 1
* 2 2  #=> 4
/ 4 2  #=> 2
% 10 6 #=> 4
^ 2 3  #=> 8
```
